## Check a Package

This GitHub action tests an R package at the repository root. 


### Secrets

None.


### Environment Variables

- [**`R_LIBS`**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/libPaths.html), a vector of paths prepended to existing `.libPaths()`.
    
    Defaults to `R_LIBS_WORKFLOW` (`[$HOME](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-github-actions/accessing-the-runtime-environment/#filesystem)/lib/R/library`) where they persist over the run of the workflow.
    All earlier or later actions that have `R_LIBS_WORKFLOW` in their `.libPaths()` can install to or load from this path.
    
    For more details, read the vignette on action [isolation](/articles/isolation/).


### Arguments

None.
